"Nobody will find out your excellent inner through your sloppy appearance", says Yang LAN. 

You haven’t a second chance to make a first impression. The image of the man is the wealth of the family.

If you have dandruff on your shoulders, your teeth are not clean, you smell bad, Please be careful, because no one will tell you the truth!

The image hides in the detail where success or failure lies on.
